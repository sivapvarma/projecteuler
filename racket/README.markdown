## [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/ "Racket Homepage")

Racket is a dialect of Lisp and a descendant of Scheme. This is my attempt
to learn Scheme while reading [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs") by Harold Abelson,
Gerald Jay Sussman and Julie Sussman.
